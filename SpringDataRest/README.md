## 🔍 Overview

Spring Data REST simplifies the process of exposing JPA repositories as RESTful APIs. Instead of manually creating controllers, this project automatically generates endpoints for CRUD operations on entities. 🏗️

---

## 🚀 Features

✨ **Automatic RESTful API Generation** – No need to write controllers manually.  
🔗 **HATEOAS Support** – Hypermedia-driven API responses.  
📈 **Pagination & Sorting** – Built-in support for paginated results.  
🔍 **Custom Query Methods** – Define repository methods and expose them via REST.  
🔒 **Security Integration** – Can be extended with Spring Security for authentication.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

🖥️ **Spring Boot**  
🔌 **Spring Data JPA**  
📡 **Spring Data REST**  
🗄️ **H2 / MySQL / PostgreSQL (Database)**  
🛠️ **Maven / Gradle**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

🔹 **Java 17+**  
🔹 **Maven or Gradle**  
🔹 **Spring Boot**  
🔹 **Git**

### ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GVHemanth1/Projects.git
cd Projects/SpringDataRest
```
### ▶️ Running the Application
Use Maven to build and run the project:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on http://localhost:8080 🌍

### 🔗 API Endpoints
Spring Data REST automatically exposes repository endpoints. Here are some examples:

🔍 Method	🛣️ Endpoint	📌 Description
GET	/entities	Fetch all entities
GET	/entities/{id}	Fetch entity by ID
POST	/entities	Create a new entity
PUT	/entities/{id}	Update an entity
DELETE	/entities/{id}	Delete an entity
For custom queries, Spring Data REST provides /search endpoints:

```
GET /entities/search/findByName?name=example
```
### 🎨 Customization
You can customize the exposed REST endpoints using annotations like:

```
@RepositoryRestResource(path = "custom-path")
public interface MyRepository extends JpaRepository<MyEntity, Long> {
}
```
Additionally, you can modify response formats, disable certain endpoints, or integrate security 🔐
